            <h2>Question 6</h2>
            <h3>Choose two sites that are similar in nature or have a similar target audience, such as the <br><br>
                Amazon.com (http://www.amazon.com) <br><br>and Alibaba.com (https://www.alibaba.com/)<br><br>
                Describe how the two sites you chose to review exhibit the design principles of repetition,
                contrast, proximity, and alignment.</h3>

            <p>
                <strong>Repetition:</strong><br>
                Both sites keep things consistent to create a familiar look and feel. You'll notice that they use the same logos, navigation menus, and search bars across different pages. They also stick to a consistent style of fonts and colors throughout their sites, which helps with branding and makes everything feel connected.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Contrast:</strong><br>
                To make important stuff stand out, both Amazon and Alibaba use contrast. They use different colors to make buttons, links, and important sections catch your eye. For example, the "Add to Cart" buttons are usually in a color that stands out from the rest of the page, making it clear where to click. They also make sure that product images are shown against backgrounds that make them pop, so you can see them clearly.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Proximity:</strong><br>
                Both sites group similar things together to make it easier for you to understand and find what you're looking for. They keep product listings close together, showing you the important details like name, price, and rating in a compact format. This way, you can quickly compare products. They also put related options and features close to the products, like shipping details and customer reviews, so you have all the info you need in one place.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Alignment:</strong></Alignment:><br>
                Alignment helps keep things organized and easy to read. Amazon and Alibaba use a consistent alignment for text, images, and other elements on their sites. You'll notice that everything is neatly lined up, following a grid or invisible lines. This makes the pages look clean and professional. When you're reading product descriptions, checking out user reviews, or looking at additional info, it's all nicely aligned, so you can find what you're looking for without any hassle.
