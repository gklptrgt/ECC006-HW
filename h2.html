            <h2>Question 1</h2>
            <p>Instead of creating another WordPress blog, I opted to create a blog on my own website. I have utilized
                WordPress extensively in the past few years, but I am not fond of their design approach. I prefer to
                develop my own style and system for my blog.
            </p>

            <h2>Question 2</h2>
            <h3>a) Why was the Internet Society created?</h3>
            <p>In 1992, the Internet Society (ISOC) was formed by a group of individuals who played a crucial role in
                inventing the internet, such as Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn. Their primary goal was to ensure that the
                internet was used to benefit people globally.
                <br><br>
                The ISOC's key responsibility is to guarantee that the internet is open and available to everyone,
                enabling innovation, economic progress, and social advancement. The organization brings together a
                diverse range of individuals, including technology experts, policymakers, and businesses, who are
                passionate about the internet.
            </p>

            <h3>b) Determine which local chapter is closest to you. Visit its website. List the website' s URL
                and an activity or service that the chapter provides.</h3>
            <p>There is one showing in Cyprus but I couldn't find the official website, second closest is in TÃ¼rkiye,
                <a rel="noopener" class="links" href="https://isoc.org.tr/" target="_blank">Internet Society Turkey
                    Chapter</a>.
                Some of the Projects that they provide; <br><br>
                <strong>Youth Internet Governance Forum Turkey</strong><br>
                The 2018 Youth Internet Governance Forum Turkey covered how the internet affects everyday life, personal
                life, and professional life. The discussion also included various topics related to internet governance,
                such as digital literacy, entrepreneurship, digital security, domain name management, software ethics,
                and digital rights. The forum's agenda was determined by and for young people.
            </p>

            <h3>c) How can you join the Internet Society? What does it cost to join? Would you recommend
                that a beginning Web developer join the Internet Society? Why or why not?</h3>
            <p>
                To become an official chapter of the Internet Society, you need to apply with an official application, a
                completed set of draft bylaws conforming to their policies, and at least 25 members subscribed as
                Internet Society members. The application is valid for 6 months, and the formation process needs to be
                completed within this timeframe.
                <br><br>
                Joining the Internet Society allows you to contribute to the worldwide effort towards an open Internet
                that is accessible to everyone, regardless of their location. Anyone, anywhere can become a member, and
                <strong>membership is free of charge</strong>.
                <br><br>
                I would strongly recommend anyone to become a member of the Internet Society, as it not only helps them
                to grow personally but also contributes to making the Internet accessible to people worldwide.
            </p>

            <h2>Question 3</h2>
            <h3>a) How can you join WebProfessionals.org? What does it cost to join?</h3>

            <h3>b) List one of the events in which WebProfessionals.org participates. Would you like to
                attend this event? Why or why not?</h3>
            <p>
                In fall 2016, the World Organization of Webmasters (WOW) is hosting a series of webinars instead of
                in-person events because many people have tight budgets. WOW members will get access details in their
                fall newsletter for the webinars, which include topics like Best practices when starting to work with a
                client, Web Accessibility with an emphasis on ARIA, and Security fundamentals. The webinars will happen
                at 2 p.m. Chicago time on October 20, November 10, and December 1, 2016. If you can't make it to the
                live webinars, don't worry, as they will be recorded and available for members to view later.
            </p>

            <h2>Question 4</h2>
            <h3>a) What is the URL of the site?</h3>
            <p>
                <a class="links" href="https://www.submarinecablemap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Submarine
                    Cable Map</a>
            </p>

            <h3>b) What is the purpose of the site?</h3>
            <p>
                A submarine cable map is a visual representation of the network of undersea cables that carry
                telecommunications and internet traffic between different continents and countries. These cables are
                laid on the ocean floor and connect countries and continents that are thousands of miles apart. The map
                typically shows the routes of the cables and the landing points where they connect to the land-based
                networks. It can also show the capacity and ownership of the cables, as well as the location of major
                data centers and internet exchange points. The submarine cable map provides an overview of the global
                infrastructure that enables the flow of information and data across the world.
            </p>

            <h3>c) Who is the intended audience?</h3>
            <p>
                The intended audience for a submarine cable map includes professionals in the telecommunications and
                internet industries, researchers, policymakers, and anyone interested in the global flow of information
                and data. It can also be useful for businesses that rely on international data transfer, such as
                e-commerce companies, financial institutions, and media organizations. Additionally, the map can be of
                interest to the general public who are curious about the underlying infrastructure of the internet and
                how information is transmitted across the world.
            </p>

            <h3>d) Do you think that the site reaches its intended audience? Why or why not?</h3>
            <p>
                Based on the site's design and content, it seems to provide valuable information and resources for
                professionals in the telecommunications and internet industries, researchers, policymakers, and other
                interested parties. The site also appears to be well-maintained and regularly updated, which is a good
                indication that it is serving its intended purpose.
            </p>

            <h3>e) Is the site useful to you? Why or why not?</h3>
            <p>
                I find the submarine cable map site to be quite useful. It provides a visual representation of the
                global telecommunications infrastructure, which is a vital aspect of computer engineering. The site
                includes detailed information on submarine cables, landing stations, and the companies that operate
                them, making it a great resource for studying topics such as networking, data transmission, and
                telecommunications.
            </p>

            <h3>f) Does this site appeal to you? Why or why not? Consider the use of color, images,
                multimedia, organization, and ease of navigation.</h3>
            <p>
                The submarine cable map is well-designed with a clear layout and easy navigation. The use of colors and
                images is effective in conveying information about the undersea cables and their routes. The interactive
                features, such as the ability to click on a cable for more information, are useful and engaging.
                Overall, the site is well-organized and visually appealing, making it easy for users to find the
                information they need.
            </p>

            <h3>g) Would you encourage others to visit this site? Why or why not?</h3>
            <p>
                I would recommend this site to anyone who wants to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying
                structure of the internet and the global network of submarine cables that make it all possible.
            </p>

            <h3>h) How could this site be improved?</h3>
            <p>
                In my opinion, the site could be improved by adding more interactive features such as quizzes or
                tutorials to help visitors better understand the content. Additionally, the site could benefit from a
                clearer and more consistent layout, as well as more visually appealing graphics and images.
